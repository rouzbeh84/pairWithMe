## **What is Pair Programming?**

Pair Programming in its simplest form is just two people working together on a project. We recommend when programming to follow the driver/navigator method to be the most efficient. This essentially means one partner, the driver, types while the other, the navigator, researches problems and checks the drivers work.

*   [Quick guide on the rules of Pair Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html)

## **Why Pair Program?**

Pair Programming allows you to have two minds working on the same problem making it much easier to solve. It also encourages you to express your logic in an efficient heuristic manner. Pair programming helps you write better code and understand what you've made much etter.

### **How to Pair Program?**

To pair program take shifts revolving every 15 to 30 minutes or every other challenge. As one partner takes on the role of driver and actually types out the code. The other partner assumes the role of navigator and they are in charge of research and helping the driver through blocks. As the driver types the navigator should watch for errors and problems with the logic. At all times both partners should be able to articulate there logic and thoughts.

### **How to Remote Pair Program?**

Remote pair programming can be simple and just as efficient as in person programming. We recommend using a text editor in which you can share a workspace and some form of video chatting. Other than that you basically do the same thing as you would in person with a little bit more articulation of your thoughts since you can not read body language as well.

### **What is A Good Project?**

<span data-reactid=".0.1.2.4.1.0">All projects are a good project. Pick a project goal in scope for your skill level and just have fun with it. Just because your project is not ground breaking or has been done before does not mean your project is not good! [www.ideaswatch.com](http://www.ideaswatch.com/startup-ideas/app) <span data-reactid=".0.1.2.4.1.2">is a great site to find project ideas as well.
